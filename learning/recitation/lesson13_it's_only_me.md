Lesson 13 It's Only Me
After the husband had gone to work, Mrs.Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to bedroom. She was too excited to do the housework in the morning, for in the evening she would be going to a fancy-dress-up party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume was only consisted of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, she went downstairs and wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as she was entering the dining room, there was a knock from the front door. She knew it must be the baker.She had told him to come straight in if she ever failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten this poor guy, Mrs.Richards quickly hid in the storeroom under the stairs. She heard the door open and heavy footsteps in the hall. Suddenly the door of storeroom was opened and a man entered. She realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board which had come to read the metre. She tried to explain the situation, saying "it's only me", but it was too late. The man let out cry and jumped back several paces. When Mrs.Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.
