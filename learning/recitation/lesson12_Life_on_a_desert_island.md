lesson12 Life on a desert island
Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagined a desert island to be a sort of paradise where sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruits falls from the trees and you never have to work. The other side of these pictures is quite the opposite. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth on both these pictures, but few us have had the oppotunity to find out.
Two man who recently spent 5 days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking badly damaged boat from Virgini island to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded to a small rubber dinghy with food matches and cans of beer, and rowed for a few miles across the Caribean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The man collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. They caught lobster and fish every day , and,  as one of them put it "ate like a king". when a passing tanker rescued them 5 days later, both man were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.
